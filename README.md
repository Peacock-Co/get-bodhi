# get-bodhi
2D Game part of Ironhack's first project

Inspired on the 90ths movie, Point Break, with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. 
It is the scene where Johnny Utah (Keanu) is left on the plane with no parachutes while Bodhi (Patrick)
jumps out of the plane with one "Adios amigo". 

The objetive of the game is to catch Bodhi dodging the birds and not die smashed on the floor!!.
